I recently wrapped up my summer at Quixey and drove back down to school to begin my second year. It's been a great and productive summer, and I have learned a tremondous amount in the past three months. Here are the top takeaways from summer 2013:

** 1. Breaks are important ** 

Every impatient software engineer knows that bugs can be extremely frustrating. Every once in a while you encounter an issue that causes you to go insane. They usually seem trivial at first, but before you know it, minutes are turning into hours as you furiously scan through documentation, stack overflow posts, anything that may lead to a solution. The longer I spent on a bug, the more frustrated I felt, and the more compelled I felt to not give up and try to solve it more quickly. This downward time-draining cycle can be deadly. Avoid it by **taking a break**. Go for a jog, eat a snack, chat with a buddy, meditate, do anything that gets your mind off of the problem. Chances are when you come back, your mind will be clear and you will be ready to tackle the problem with full focus and no frustration. There have been a few late nights where I was furiously hacking away on a problem, frustrated, angry, and not making any progess. The funny thing is (after I eventually gave up and went home) I would usually come in the next morning and solve the issue within 15 minutes. Now, every time I work on a problem without making progess for an hour, I simply drop it. Effeciency is important, but breaks are necessary. Don't be afraid to take one if you need it.

** 2. Product Management is hard **

The team I worked on this summer had some very talented engineers. I used to think that was all you needed. A team smart enough to design and engineer a product should surely be able to manage their team effectively to see that product come to fruition, right? Not exactly. Keeping a bunch of engineers on track and working toward the same goal, it turns out, is extremely difficult. Even with a daily standup, miscommunication and lack of clear direction prevented us from working at maximum effeciency for a long time. Eventually, we learned enough to start using [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), but still wasted a bunch of time on management overhead. If engineers are sled dogs, then the PM is the human that builds the sled, puts the dogs on their leashes, and drives the sled in the right direction. I have a newfound respect for product management, as this summer has taught me how difficult that job is to do well. Shout out to my boy [Hadar](http://www.linkedin.com/in/hadardor).

** 3. Learn git **

If you are an engineer and not already familiar with git, go [learn](http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) it now. Seriously, you'll need it eventually.

** 4. Macs are amazing **

For some reason I used to have this notion that that Apple computer products were only for the non tech-savvy. But after this summer, I have to admit that I have become what I used to despise: an apple fanboy. Yes, most apple products are infuriangtly overpriced for their technical specs (a [24-inch Thunderbolt Display](http://www.apple.com/thunderbolt/) is $1000... what the fuck apple). Yes, you could get an equally powerful windows based laptop for half the price of a macbook and install ubuntu (or even a pirated copy of OS X) on it. But I'll be damned if the 13" Macbook Pro with Retina Display I used this summer isn't the most beautiful machine I have ever owned. As much as they cost, haters have to admit that apple products are extremely well built and designed, to the very last detail. Plus, the OSX operating system is beautifully easy to use, for computer experts and beginners alike. If you are struggling financially, I would still opt for the fairly priced ASUS laptop. But if you have money (as most well funded startups do), I would go for the Mac everytime. ** Mac OSX > Linux > ... > Windows. **

I am continuing to work twenty hours a week remotely while taking classes at UCLA. It's been a blast. No complaints so far except that the internet here is terrible. I'm gonna need to do something about that...

Here is a beautiful view of Westwood and beyond from my dorm room in Dykstra Hall:
