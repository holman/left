title: Climbing up walls

I started bouldering this summer, following in the footsteps of many of my friends in the bay. The basic premise is this: you climb up a wall and then jump off when you reach the top. Then you go to another wall and repeat. To some people this comes naturally; I am not one of those people. It's been two weeks and the only thing I feel like I'm getting better at the slackline the climbing gym has set up in the back.

The toughest thing about climbing for me is the endurance factor. After just a few climbs it feels like my arms are going to fall off. The way I see it there are two possibilities:

1.   Everybody experiences this arm pain but ignores it and keeps trucking, in which case I am a pussy.
2.   My arms have not built the muscle endurance to handle climbing for more than an hour at a time, in which case I am a weakling.

I'm not sure which I prefer more...
