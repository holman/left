This is a draft post that isn't ready for the wild. See how it doesn't show up in your list of posts, nor in your RSS feed? You can, however, [link](/posts/draft/) directly to it.

To make it go live, all you have to do is remove the `draft:true` line, and you're off to the races.

You'll want to [get the code][left] and read the README to learn how to
install and set up Left for your own purposes.
