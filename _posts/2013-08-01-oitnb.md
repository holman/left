I heard about this new show about life in women's prison a few weeks back. It comes from the creators of Weeds, a show I have never been too enthusiastic about, so I was initially skeptical. But I decided to give it a chance, and boy am I glad. It turns out that female prisons (at least the way this show writes them) are actually... really intersting.

The show starts out slow, with the first episode hitting all the classic prison cliche's with a comedic tone. Some of the humor is entertaining, but the real appeal of this show to me are the diverse characters: A russian mob housewife inmate that controls the kitchen and with it, most of the prisoners. An unstable lesbian stalker aptly nicknamed "Crazy Eyes". A latino daughter who gets placed in the same cell as her mother, with whom she doesn't get along. A racist, sexist, sadistic prison guard who all the inmates call "Pornstache". And of course, a fair share of drug addicts.

The relationships all these characters develop are intricate and complex. At first it seems as though the inmates are completely divided. The are clear groups defined by race: the whites, the blacks, the latinos, and my personal favorite, "the others". But as the plot thickens and the characters develop, you see that it really isn't that simple. Every character has depth: even ones that are introduced as one-sided personalities in the beginning of the seasons surprise you with occasional glimpses of humanity. Flashbacks in the style of <i>Lost</i> also add to this depth.

The main character is presented a white woman from the middle class who happened to get mixed up with some drug smuggling in her "rebellious" post-college period. The initial appeal of the show is her juxtaposition against the rest of the inmates, who mostly come from poverty and minority backgrounds. It's fascinating and hilarious to see her interact with this vastly different world she finds in prison. But what really got to me about this show is when I started to realize that, when you look past their superficial differences (ethnicity, sexual orientation, educational background), these inmates are all very similar. As one of the characters puts it, <b>"We all make bad choices. It's just some of us got different bad choices to make."</b>

I highly reccomend checking this show out if you get the chance. I give the first season a 9/10 and will definitely be coming back for the second.
On a side note, I hope this trend of netflix exclusives continues; between this show, House of Cards, and Arrested Development season 4, they have proved that they can produce high quality content. Plus they just released the first half Breaking Bad Season 5, just in time for the priemiere next week! That company has got their shit together, I would love to intern there.
