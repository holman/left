Swiplur, the app I've been developing for the past few weeks, dropped onto the iOS App Store yesterday! It's a swipe marketplace for college campuses that helps facilitate the buying and selling of meal swipes for dining halls. It currently supports UCLA and UC Davis campus, with plans to expand to more if successful. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/swiplur/id748927884">Check it out</a>.
