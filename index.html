  <p>I'm a Computer Science student at <a href="http://www.ucla.edu/">UCLA</a>, originally . I'm interested in technology, startups, and technology startups. I also enjoy music, surfing, and following television shows.
  <p>This summer, I am interning at <a href="http://www.quixey.com/">Quixey</a>, a startup in Mountain View, as part of their Research Team. I get to work on exciting problems with ridiculously talented engineers. I also get free food, snacks, and a little bit of money. It's pretty sweet.</p>
