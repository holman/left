# Left

Left is a clean, whitespace-happy layout for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

This is designed to be an easy layout to modify for your own blog. It was
extracted from [zachholman.com](http://zachholman.com/), which means it was
battle-hardened from years of posting serious blog posts about emoji and swear
words.

## Installation

- Install Jekyll: `gem install jekyll`
- [Fork this repository](https://github.com/holman/left/fork)
- Clone it: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USER/left`
- Run the jekyll server: `jekyll serve`

You should have a server up and running locally at <http://localhost:4000>.

## Customization

Next you'll want to change a few things. Most of them can be changed directly in
[_config.yml](https://github.com/holman/left/blob/master/_config.yml). That's
where we'll pull your name, Twitter username, and things like that.

There's a few other places that you'll want to change, too:

- [CNAME](https://github.com/holman/left/blob/master/CNAME): If you're using
  this on GitHub Pages with a custom domain name, you'll want to change this
  to be the domain you're going to use. All that should be in here is a
  domain name on the first line and nothing else (like: `example.com`).
- [favicon.ico](https://github.com/holman/left/blob/master/favicon.ico): This
  is a smaller version of my gravatar for use as the icon in your browser's
  address bar. You should change it to whatever you'd like.
- [apple-touch-icon.png](https://github.com/holman/left/blob/master/apple-touch-icon.png):
  Again, this is my gravatar, and it shows up in iOS and various other apps
  that use this file as an "icon" for your site.

## Deployment

You should deploy with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com)- it's just
easier.

All you should have to do is rename your repository on GitHub to be
`username.github.com`. Since everything is on the `gh-pages` branch, you
should be able to see your new site at <http://username.github.io>.

## Licensing

This is [MIT](https://github.com/holman/left/blob/master/LICENSE) with no
added caveats, so feel free to use this on your site without linking back to
me or using a disclaimer or anything silly like that.

If you'd like give me credit somewhere on your blog or tweet a shout out to
[@holman](https://twitter.com/holman), well hey, I'll take it.
